# Snake

This is my CS2 Project @WIT.
Due Date : 4 / 17 / 19

Name of Project: SkillSnake

Project Description: This is a remake of the snake game. As a snake game can be very boring, I decided to make snake a little more skilled based. I did this by adding walls onto the map. While adding walls may seem like a bad idea, I think it would make the overall game more fun. I also 3 lives to the snake game so it won't be too hard to play. If this remake of snake it not your taste, I've also added the classic version of snake so all is well!

Plan(for this project) : 

What I planned: 
- Week 1: Build GUI
- Week 2: Build snake nodes, movements
- Week 3: build walls, food, score counters, modes
- Week 4: make them work together
- Week 5: clean up code

What Actually Happened: 
- Week 1: Build GUI
- Week 2: nothing(zzz)
- Week 3: nothing(zzz)
- Week 4: Build everything
- Week 5: Build everything but clean up

Topics Covered : 
- Class definition(Does not include main/static methods/variables)
- Abstract classes/interfaces
- Generics/Iterators/Collections
- Recursion

Bugs :
- If you hold down on an arrow keys or WASD, the snake will stop
- Might throw an error somewhere in the game
- Might not eat the apple sometimes
- Did not set up snake hit detection on itself yet so the snake can overlap itself
- Winner Labels stack 


What I Learned From this Project : 
- I should really learn how to properly use github and learn use debug mode while programming. My method of debugging thoughout this project was System.out.println() which is easy to use but a lot to work to clean up after.
