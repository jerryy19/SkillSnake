# Snake

This is my CS2 Project @WIT.
Due Date : 4 / 17 / 19

Name of Project: SkillSnake
Developer(s) : Jerry Yu

Project Description: This is a remake of the snake game. As a snake game can be very boring, I decided to make snake a little more skilled based. I did this by adding walls onto the map. While adding walls may seem like a bad idea, I think it would make the overall game more fun. I also 3 lives to the snake game so it won't be too hard to play. If this remake of snake it not your taste, I've also added the classic version of snake so all is well!

Topics Covered : 
- Class definition(Does not include main/static methods/variables)
- Abstract classes/interfaces
- Generics/Iterators/Collections
- Recursion

Original Purpose : The reason why I decided to remake the snake game is because I find the classic version of snake kind of bland. With this in mind, I decided to remake the snake game to be a little bit more skilled based because of the current gaming trends. Now adays, in my opinion, games require more precise movements which overall, makes the game more fun because it requires you to be more cognizant (might be more fun because of short attention span and can't handle idleness). 


What I Learned From this Project : 
- I should really learn how to properly use github and learn use debug mode in eclipse while programming. My method of debugging thoughout this project was System.out.println() which is easy to use but a lot to work to clean up after. 
- It is till hard to keep track of fields and methods even if you separate them out into methods and classes. 
- I also learned that planning for a project is very difficult because it is completely different than just following instructions and doing a project. 
- The last thing I learned from this project is to not to partner up with some of my friends for projects. My plan was just to focus on the project by ourselves; I would build the new version of snake while my partner would work on the classic version of snake. Then, I would integrate our work together and all would be good. I ended up doing everything myself. 

Bugs that arised :
- If you hold down on an arrow keys or WASD, the snake will stop
- Might throw an error somewhere in the game
- Might not eat the apple sometimes
- Winner Labels stack if you win and does not disappear

What I didn't get done in this project : 
- There was quite a bit that I wanted to do for this project but I couldn't because of my procrastination. I've actually finished building my user interface in the first week. Some of the features for my game was to:
- create a shoot function for the snake. The snake would shoot poison and erode the wall so you don't have to deal with the wall, otherwise, you die on impact. In the end, I just let the snake pass through the wall and kill the last 2 snake bodies. 
- snake would die if it overlapped
- more apples on the board so you can choose which apples to eat first
- separate the scores from different modes. Highscore stays the same throughout the modes. 
- score multiplier. Different modes have different scoring systems.
- end game button is not centered(this part really annoyed me)


What I planned: 
- Week 1: Build GUI
- Week 2: Build snake nodes, movements
- Week 3: build walls, food, score counters, modes
- Week 4: make them work together
- Week 5: clean up code

What Actually Happened: 
- Week 1: Build GUI
- Week 2: nothing(zzz)
- Week 3: nothing(zzz)
- Week 4: Build everything
- Week 5: Build everything but clean up
