# Snake

(temporary read me. not finished yet)

This is my CS2 Project @WIT.
Due Date : 4 / 17/ 19

Name of Project: 

Project Description: This is a remake of the snake game. As a snake game can be very boring, I decided to make snake a little more
skilled based. I did this by adding walls onto the map. While adding walls may seem like a bad idea, I think it would make the overall
game more fun. I also 3 lives to the snake game so it won't be too hard to play. If this remake of snake it not your taste, I've also
added the classic version of snake so all is well!
